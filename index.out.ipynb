    "\n",
    "This study unifies the two canonical discrete choice specifications–Multinomial Logit and Multinomial Probit–within a single generative framework. I introduce a **Poisson Count Race**, wherein $K$ alternatives generate events according to independent Poisson processes. A choice is determined when an alternative reaches a specific cumulative count threshold, $\\theta$. At the threshold $\\theta=1$, the model yields the Multinomial Logit (Luce choice rule). By normalizing the utility noise to maintain a constant variance–a process termed temperature identification–I show that as $\\theta \\to \\infty$, the model converges to the Multinomial Probit. This formulation provides a parametric bridge in which $\\theta$ governs the shape of the error distribution and a separate parameter, $\\beta$, modulates the temperature. Crucially, this bridge arises from a single stochastic accumulation mechanism rather than from post hoc variance matching between distinct models.\n",

    "# 2. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete choice models based on Random Utility Theory (RUT) form a central pillar of mathematical psychology, econometrics, and cognitive science. Across these fields, it is common to assume that each alternative in a choice set elicits a latent scalar quantity–often interpreted as strength, utility, or evidence–and that observed choices arise from a comparison of these latent quantities under stochastic variability. Despite the diversity of substantive applications, two modeling traditions dominate this landscape: logit-based models, derived from Luce’s choice axiom and extreme-value theory, and probit-based models, derived from Gaussian signal detection theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The central question addressed in this paper is this: Can the two canonical random-utility discrete-choice specifications—multinomial logit and multinomial probit—be derived as limit cases of a single stochastic accumulation/race mechanism, so that the logit–probit relationship is explained by a unified generative process rather than by informal distributional similarity or variance matching?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Multinomial Logit (MNL) model arises when stochastic variability is modeled via independent Gumbel (Type I Extreme Value) disturbances added to deterministic utilities. This specification is tightly linked to Luce’s ratio-of-strengths axiom ([Luce 1959](#ref-Luce1959)) and admits a well-known generative interpretation: if each alternative generates stochastic events according to an independent exponential clock, the probability that an alternative is chosen first is proportional to its rate. This exponential race interpretation has played a foundational role in mathematical psychology and economics, and it underlies a broad class of models including the Plackett–Luce ranking model and the “Gumbel–max trick” widely used in machine learning ([McFadden 1974](#ref-McFadden1974); [Yellott 1977](#ref-Yellott1977)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Multinomial Probit (MNP) model, by contrast, assumes Gaussian noise on latent utilities and traces its lineage to Thurstone’s theory of comparative judgment ([Thurstone 1927](#ref-Thurstone1927)) and later developments in psychometrics and signal detection theory ([Bock and Jones 1968](#ref-BockJones1968)). Probit models are often motivated by appeal to aggregation, pooling, or measurement noise, and they offer greater flexibility in representing correlated disturbances across alternatives. Unlike logit, however, probit does not admit a simple closed-form choice rule, nor does it enjoy an equally canonical process-level interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although logit and probit are often treated as interchangeable in practice, their conceptual relationship remains surprisingly underdeveloped. It is well known that logistic and Gaussian cumulative distribution functions closely approximate one another under variance matching in binary choice tasks, and this observation is frequently cited to justify pragmatic model choice. Yet this numerical similarity is rarely given a deeper theoretical explanation. Instead, logit and probit are typically presented as competing assumptions about the distribution of unobserved utility noise, reflecting different historical traditions rather than different instantiations of a common mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent work has renewed attention to this issue. Robinson, Clevenger, and Irwin ([2023](#ref-Robinson2023)) revisited the tension between Luce-based choice models and signal detection theory, applying a critical test of parameter invariance across changes in the number of alternatives ($m$). Their empirical analysis demonstrated that Gaussian signal detection parameters ($d'$) remained stable as the choice set size increased, whereas softmax parameters ($\\beta$) exhibited systematic variance. While this diagnostic work highlights the superior generalization of Gaussian assumptions in certain memory tasks, it leaves open the generative question: is there a single mechanism that can account for both regimes?\n",
    "\n",
    "The present work addresses this by shifting perspective. Rather than beginning with static assumptions about utility noise, this paper begins with a stochastic accumulation process and asks what class of random utility models it induces. A related line of work is the dependent Poisson race model of Ruan et al. ([2008](#ref-Ruan2008)), who develop a thresholded accumulation process for binary conjoint choice. Their focus, however, is on modeling dependence between alternatives via shared Poisson components, rather than on the distributional consequences of thresholded accumulation for the logit–probit relationship. The present contribution is complementary: by restricting attention to independent races and introducing a variance-preserving identification, it derives both multinomial logit and multinomial probit as endpoint regimes of a single generative family.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 A stochastic accumulation perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "I introduce a **Poisson count race**, a simple generative model in which each alternative produces stochastic events over time according to an independent Poisson process. A decision is made when one alternative reaches a fixed cumulative count threshold, denoted by $\\theta$. The threshold $\\theta$ thus controls how much stochastic evidence must be accumulated before commitment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Psychologically, $\\theta$ can be interpreted as a commitment criterion or decision caution parameter: higher thresholds require more accumulated events before choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "This construction generalizes the classical exponential race in a minimal way. When $\\theta = 1$, the model reduces exactly to the familiar exponential race, recovering Luce’s choice rule and the Multinomial Logit model without approximation. For $\\theta > 1$, choice depends not on the first event, but on the time required to accumulate multiple events, introducing a new degree of freedom into the stochastic mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crucially, the Poisson count race admits an exact Random Utility representation. The waiting time for an alternative to reach $\\theta$ events follows a Gamma (Erlang) distribution, and comparing these waiting times is equivalent to comparing latent utilities composed of a deterministic component and a stochastic component with a log-Gamma distribution. Varying the threshold $\\theta$ therefore induces a one-parameter family of random utility models with a shared systematic utility but systematically varying noise distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the Poisson count race is an accumulation process, the present work does not aim to model response times or trial-by-trial dynamics. Instead, accumulation is used here as a generative device for inducing a family of random utility models with interpretable noise structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Noise scale, noise shape, and identification\n",
    "\n",
    "A central difficulty in comparing discrete choice models with different error distributions is the identification of scale. In standard practice, the scale of utility noise is absorbed into the coefficients, making it difficult to compare models with different distributional assumptions on equal footing. This issue is particularly salient when contrasting logit and probit models, whose error distributions differ not only in shape but also in variance and tail behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, I introduce a **temperature identification** that standardizes the stochastic component of utility to have fixed variance across all values of $\\theta$. This separates two conceptually distinct aspects of randomness in choice:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Noise scale**, controlled by a temperature parameter $\\beta$, which governs the overall magnitude of stochasticity relative to systematic utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Noise shape**, controlled by the accumulation threshold $\\theta$, which determines the distributional form of the stochastic component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under this identification, increasing $\\theta$ does not trivially eliminate noise by driving the model toward deterministic choice. Instead, it isolates the effect of changing the shape of stochasticity while holding its magnitude fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3 Logit and probit as endpoint regimes\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the temperature-identified Poisson count race, two classical models emerge as limiting cases of a single generative mechanism. When $\\theta = 1$, the stochastic utility component is exactly Gumbel distributed, yielding the **Multinomial Logit** model without approximation. As $\\theta \\to \\infty$, the standardized log-Gamma noise converges in distribution to a Gaussian by the Central Limit Theorem, and the resulting choice probabilities converge to those of the **Multinomial Probit** model. From this perspective, the familiar distinction between logit and probit reflects differences in the stopping rule governing an evidence accumulation process, rather than fundamentally distinct assumptions about decision noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the paper establishes three results: (1) Multinomial Logit arises exactly as the single-event threshold case of a Poisson race; (2) Multinomial Probit emerges as a non-degenerate asymptotic limit under temperature identification; and (3) intermediate accumulation thresholds correspond to log-Gamma random utility models with a clear process interpretation. The remainder of the paper formalizes this framework, presents simulations illustrating the interpolation between regimes, and discusses implications for discrete choice modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Formal statement of random utility models\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a decision-maker facing a set of $K \\ge 2$ mutually exclusive alternatives. The utility associated with alternative $i$ is decomposed into a systematic component, $v_i$, and a stochastic component, $\\epsilon_i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U_{i} = v_{i} + \\epsilon_{i}, \\quad i=1, \\dots, K$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision-maker selects the alternative that maximizes utility:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C = \\arg \\max_{i} U_{i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Classically, the distributional assumptions regarding $\\epsilon_i$ dictate the structural form of the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Gumbel Errors:** If the $\\epsilon_i$ terms are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) according to a Type I Extreme Value distribution, the choice probabilities follow the **Multinomial Logit (MNL)** or Softmax form.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Gaussian Errors:** If the $\\epsilon_i$ terms follow a Multivariate Normal distribution, the choice probabilities are described by the **Multinomial Probit (MNP)** model.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Logit model offers analytical tractability, the Probit model permits more flexible covariance structures. This paper derives a mechanism that naturally interpolates between these two regimes through a stochastic race process.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. The Generative Model: A Poisson Count Race\n",
    "\n",
    "Let the accumulation of evidence or preference for each alternative $i$ be modeled by independent Poisson processes, denoted $N_i(t)$, with rate parameters $\\lambda_i > 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, define a **Count Race** characterized by an integer threshold $\\theta \\ge 1$. The process terminates when any single process accumulates $\\theta$ events.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 1 (Stopping Time).** The stopping time for the system is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tau_{\\theta} = \\inf \\{t \\ge 0 : \\max_{i} N_i(t) = \\theta \\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 2 (Choice).** The chosen alternative is the specific process that triggers the stopping time:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C = \\arg \\max_{i} N_i(\\tau_{\\theta})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.1 Transformation to Waiting Times\n",
    "\n",
    "To map this stochastic process to a utility framework, consider $T_i^{(\\theta)}$, the waiting time until the $i$-th process records its $\\theta$-th event:\n",

    "\n",
    "## 4.2 The Random Utility Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the Poisson processes $N_1(t), \\ldots, N_K(t)$ are mutually independent, the waiting times $T_1^{(\\theta)}, \\ldots, T_K^{(\\theta)}$ are also mutually independent. By the scaling property of the Gamma distribution, each waiting time can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T_i^{(\\theta)} \\stackrel{d}{=} \\frac{G_i}{\\lambda_i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $G_1, \\ldots, G_K \\stackrel{\\text{i.i.d.}}{\\sim} \\text{Gamma}(\\theta, 1)$ are mutually independent standard Gamma random variables. Consequently, the choice problem is formulated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C = \\arg \\min_{i} \\left( \\frac{G_i}{\\lambda_i} \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying the natural logarithm, a monotonic transformation, reverses the optimization direction from minimization to maximization:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned} C &= \\arg \\min_{i} (\\log G_i - \\log \\lambda_i) \\\\ &= \\arg \\max_{i} (\\log \\lambda_i - \\log G_i) \\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This establishes an exact RUM structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U_i^{(\\theta)} = v_i + \\epsilon_i^{(\\theta)}$$\n",

    "-   **Stochastic Error:** $\\epsilon_i^{(\\theta)} = -\\log G_i$, with $G_i \\sim \\text{Gamma}(\\theta, 1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the Poisson count race is isomorphic to a Random Utility Model characterized by Log-Gamma noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. The Logit Boundary ($\\theta = 1$)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the specific instance where the threshold is a single event ($\\theta = 1$), the waiting time distribution simplifies:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$G_i \\sim \\text{Gamma}(1, 1) \\equiv \\text{Exponential}(1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A fundamental property of the Gumbel distribution is its relationship to the Exponential distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X \\sim \\text{Exp}(1) \\implies -\\log(X) \\sim \\text{Gumbel}(\\text{Type I EV})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, when $\\theta=1$, the noise terms $\\epsilon_i^{(1)}$ are i.i.d. Gumbel. This recovers the exact Multinomial Logit formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Pr(C=i) = \\frac{\\exp(v_i)}{\\sum_{j=1}^K \\exp(v_j)} = \\frac{\\lambda_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^K \\lambda_j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result 1:** The Poisson race with threshold $\\theta=1$ corresponds exactly to the Luce Choice Rule (Softmax). This is a classic, well-known derivation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Temperature Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "For thresholds $\\theta > 1$, the error distribution deviates from the Gumbel form. Furthermore, as $\\theta$ increases, the variance of the error term diminishes. Specifically, for $\\epsilon^{(\\theta)} = -\\log G$ where $G \\sim \\text{Gamma}(\\theta, 1)$:\n",

    "As $\\theta \\to \\infty$, $\\psi_1(\\theta) \\approx 1/\\theta \\to 0$. In the absence of standardization, the model becomes deterministic as the stochastic noise vanishes. To facilitate comparison of error “shapes” across varying $\\theta$ values, a consistent scale must be enforced. This process is referred to as **Temperature Identification**. Unlike conventional scale normalization, this identification preserves non-degenerate choice behavior as $\\theta$ increases, allowing the large-$\\theta$ limit to be meaningfully interpreted.\n",

    "This section establishes the asymptotic behavior of the temperature-identified model as the count threshold increases.\n",

    "The key observation is that $G_i \\sim \\text{Gamma}(\\theta, 1)$ can be decomposed as a sum of $\\theta$ independent exponential random variables: $G_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\theta} E_{ij}$, where $E_{ij} \\stackrel{\\text{i.i.d.}}{\\sim} \\text{Exp}(1)$. By the law of large numbers, $G_i / \\theta \\xrightarrow{p} 1$ as $\\theta \\to \\infty$. Applying the delta method with the function $g(x) = -\\log(x)$, we obtain\n",

    "\n",
    "Since the standardization $Z_i^{(\\theta)} = (-\\log G_i + \\psi(\\theta)) / \\sqrt{\\psi_1(\\theta)}$ uses $\\psi(\\theta) \\sim \\log\\theta - 1/(2\\theta)$ and $\\psi_1(\\theta) \\sim 1/\\theta$, this is asymptotically equivalent. Therefore, as $\\theta \\to \\infty$:\n",
    "\n",

    "# 8. Simulation Studies: Binary Choice\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate how the Poisson count race family interpolates between Logit and Probit, I conducted a simulation study in the binary choice setting ($K=2$). This setting admits closed-form choice probabilities and allows direct visual comparison with both classical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ denote the Poisson rates of the two alternatives, and define the log-rate ratio $x = \\log(\\lambda_1/\\lambda_2)$. The probability that alternative 1 wins the race can be expressed in closed form using the regularized incomplete Beta function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Pr(C = 1 \\mid x, \\theta) = I_{\\sigma(x)}(\\theta, \\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $I_p(a, b)$ is the regularized incomplete Beta function and $\\sigma(x) = (1 + e^{-x})^{-1}$. To see this, note that alternative 1 wins the race if and only if $T_1^{(\\theta)} < T_2^{(\\theta)}$, where $T_i^{(\\theta)} \\sim \\text{Gamma}(\\theta, \\lambda_i)$. Equivalently, defining $W = T_1^{(\\theta)} / (T_1^{(\\theta)} + T_2^{(\\theta)})$, we have $W \\sim \\text{Beta}(\\theta, \\theta)$ when evaluated at $p = \\lambda_1 / (\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2) = \\sigma(x)$, giving $\\Pr(T_1 < T_2) = I_{\\sigma(x)}(\\theta, \\theta)$. For $\\theta = 1$, this reduces exactly to $\\sigma(x)$, the logistic function.\n",
    "\n",
    "When choice probabilities are plotted directly as a function of $x$ for increasing $\\theta$, the choice function becomes increasingly steep and converges to a step function at $x = 0$, reflecting deterministic selection of the alternative with the larger rate. This confirms that without temperature identification, increasing the count threshold simply reduces stochasticity rather than inducing Gaussian behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare noise *shape* independently of noise *scale*, I adopted the temperature identification introduced in Section 5. For binary choice, the variance of the utility noise difference is $\\text{Var}(\\epsilon_1^{(\\theta)} - \\epsilon_2^{(\\theta)}) = 2\\psi_1(\\theta)$. I therefore define the standardized signal $s = x / \\sqrt{2\\psi_1(\\theta)}$. On this variance-matched axis, the Logit reference ($\\theta = 1$) uses $\\text{sd}_{\\text{diff}} = \\pi/\\sqrt{3}$ (the standard deviation of the difference of two independent Gumbel variates), and the Probit reference is simply $\\Phi(s)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the multinomial simulations, the same principle applies. The logit reference uses an effective inverse temperature of $\\pi / (\\beta\\sqrt{6})$, which ensures the Gumbel noise has standard deviation matching $\\beta$ under the unit-variance convention. The probit reference uses noise scale $\\beta$ directly. All simulations use $\\beta = 1$ unless otherwise noted. Under this normalization, the $\\theta = 1$ Poisson race coincides exactly with the variance-matched logit curve, while increasing $\\theta$ yields choice functions that converge uniformly to the probit curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because logit and probit are themselves numerically close under variance matching, the differences between models are small in absolute magnitude but systematic. To make these differences visible, <a href=\"#fig-residuals\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Figure 1</a> plots residuals relative to the variance-matched Logit model. At $\\theta = 1$, the residual is identically zero (exact Logit). As $\\theta$ increases, the residuals grow smoothly and converge toward the Probit$-$Logit difference curve, with the maximum absolute deviation from probit decaying rapidly in $\\theta$. This confirms that the temperature-identified Poisson count race defines a continuous, parameterized family of choice rules that interpolates smoothly between logit-like and probit-like behavior."

    "## 9.8 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "These multinomial simulations confirm and extend the binary-case results:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Convergence is gradual and universal**: Across different values of $K$ and different utility structures, the Poisson count race converges to the Multinomial Probit reference within $\\theta \\approx 50$–$100$ in total variation distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Probability redistribution**: As $\\theta$ increases, the probit model concentrates more probability on the best alternative and less on inferior alternatives, reflecting the thinner tails of Gaussian noise relative to Gumbel.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Set-size scaling**: The logit and probit models predict systematically different scaling of target choice probability with the number of competitors. The Poisson count race interpolates between these two patterns, connecting to the empirical findings of Robinson, Clevenger, and Irwin ([2023](#ref-Robinson2023)).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **IIA erosion**: The Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives property, which holds exactly at $\\theta = 1$, is progressively violated as $\\theta$ increases. This provides a process-level account of why IIA holds for logit but not probit: it is a consequence of the Gumbel noise shape, and alternative noise shapes—induced by higher accumulation thresholds—do not preserve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Parameter invariance**: When choice data generated by the Poisson count race are fit under a logit assumption, the recovered inverse temperature drifts with set size $K$ for all $\\theta > 1$. Conversely, when fit under a probit assumption, the recovered noise scale remains stable for large $\\theta$ but drifts when $\\theta$ is small. This cross-over in parameter invariance provides a process-level account of the empirical findings of Robinson, Clevenger, and Irwin ([2023](#ref-Robinson2023)): parameter stability across $K$ is diagnostic of whether the effective noise distribution is closer to Gumbel or Gaussian.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Noise shape transition**: The underlying mechanism is a smooth transition in the shape of the standardised noise distribution, from the skewed Gumbel ($\\theta = 1$) to the symmetric Gaussian ($\\theta \\to \\infty$). The skewness and kurtosis decay at known rates, providing analytic control over the approximation quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 10. Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The present work develops a generative framework in which Multinomial Logit and Multinomial Probit arise as endpoint regimes of a single stochastic accumulation process. By introducing a Poisson count race and a temperature identification that separates noise scale from noise shape, this paper clarifies how extreme-value and Gaussian choice behavior emerge from different stopping rules applied to the same underlying mechanism. The goal is not to advocate replacing existing models, but to clarify their relationship: logit and probit correspond to distinct regimes of evidence accumulation, characterized by how much stochastic evidence is required before commitment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multinomial simulations demonstrate that this unification is not merely a theoretical curiosity. Thresholded accumulation induces systematic, graded violations of IIA that converge toward the dependence structure characteristic of multinomial probit. This dependence emerges endogenously from the accumulation and stopping rule, rather than being imposed by construction. The parameter invariance results further connect the framework to recent empirical findings ([Robinson, Clevenger, and Irwin 2023](#ref-Robinson2023)), providing a process-level account of why Gaussian-based parameters exhibit greater stability across changes in set size.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.1 Relation to existing models\n",
    "\n",
    "From a mathematical standpoint, all components of the present framework are classical: exponential races yield Luce’s choice rule, Gamma waiting times arise from accumulated Poisson events, and asymptotic normality follows from the Central Limit Theorem. The contribution lies in assembling these elements into a single generative family and identifying the conditions under which its limiting behavior remains non-degenerate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The present model should not be conflated with full sequential sampling models such as the Diffusion Decision Model or Linear Ballistic Accumulator. Those models jointly account for response times and accuracy via continuous accumulation with explicit drift and boundary parameters. The Poisson count race is deliberately minimal: it uses accumulation as a generative device to induce a family of random utility models, without making claims about within-trial dynamics or response time distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Between the logit and probit endpoints lies a continuum of log-Gamma random utility models. These intermediate regimes are not intended as new default specifications, but they underscore that logit and probit are special cases of a broader family. Deviations from logit or probit behavior may sometimes reflect differences in accumulation thresholds rather than fundamentally different noise sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.2 Implications for empirical modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "The present framework offers a theoretical account of why logit-based and probit-based models may differ in parameter invariance across task structures. Models with larger effective accumulation thresholds naturally exhibit Gaussian-like behavior, which may confer greater stability across changes in the number of alternatives. At the same time, the results caution against interpreting superior empirical performance of one model class as evidence for a particular noise distribution in isolation: differences between logit and probit may reflect differences in decision criteria or commitment thresholds rather than differences in representational noise per se.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.3 Limitations and extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "The Poisson count race is intentionally simple. It assumes independent accumulation processes and focuses exclusively on choice probabilities, abstracting away from response times and within-trial dynamics. Extensions that allow correlated accumulators, time-varying rates, or joint modeling of choice and response time are natural directions for future work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The present analysis treats the accumulation threshold as fixed across trials and alternatives. Allowing threshold variability or adaptive stopping rules could further enrich the family of induced choice models and connect more directly to theories of decision caution and speed–accuracy trade-offs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model positions the Poisson count race as a parametric family indexed by $(\\theta, \\beta)$, but a formal identification analysis is beyond the present scope. In principle, $\\theta$ and $\\beta$ play distinct roles—shape versus scale of the noise distribution—and the shape of the psychometric function or the pattern of IIA violations could serve to identify $\\theta$ from choice data. Whether these parameters are jointly identifiable from aggregate choice frequencies alone, and under what experimental designs, remains an open question for future investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the framework naturally invites comparison with other random utility specifications. Exploring whether additional classical models arise as limiting regimes under alternative accumulation rules may provide further insight into the structure of discrete choice behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.4 Concluding remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "By grounding discrete choice models in a common stochastic accumulation process, the Poisson count race reframes a long-standing modeling distinction. Logit and probit emerge not as competing assumptions about utility noise, but as endpoint regimes corresponding to different stopping rules applied to the same underlying mechanism. This unification clarifies their conceptual relationship and provides a principled basis for comparison, illustrating how process-level reasoning can illuminate the structure of static choice models.\n",
