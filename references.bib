  abstract = {This research monograph is devoted to a theoretical (mathematical) analysis of one of the major themes of interest to psychologists: choice. The analysis begins by stating a general axiom that may hold among the probabilities of choice from related sets of alternatives. This is shown to imply the existence of a ratio scale that is then used to analyze a number of traditional problems. The 1st subject treated is psychophysics, and covers areas involving time- and space-order effects, Fechner's equal jnd problem, power law in psychophysics and its relation to discrimination data, psychophysical interaction between 2 independent physical variables and possible correlates with Stevens' distinction between prothetic and metathetic continua, Thurston's low of comparative judgment, signal detectability theory, and ranking of stimuli. The next major theme studied is utility theory. Unusual results are obtained which suggest an experiment to test the theory. Topics in learning are analyzed in a concluding chapter which uses the stochastic theories of learning as the basic approach, with the exception that distributions of response strengths are assumed to be transformed rather than response probabilities. 3 classes of learning operators emerge, both linear and nonlinear.

  abstract = {Holman and Marley have shown that Thurstone's Case V model becomes equivalent to the Choice Axiom if its discriminal processes are assumed to be independent double exponential random variables instead of normal ones. It is shown here that for pair comparisons, this representation is not unique; other discriminal process distributions (specifiable only in terms of their characteristic functions) also yield a model equivalent to the Choice Axiom. However, none of these models is equivalent to the Choice Axiom for triple comparisons: There the double exponential representation is unique. It is also shown that within the framework of Thurstone's theory, the double exponential distribution, and hence the Choice Axiom, is implied by a weaker assumption, called ``invariance under uniform expansions of the choice set.''},

  abstract = {A new psychological law, called the law of comparative judgment, is presented with some of its special applications in the measurement of psychological values. This law is applicable not only to the comparison of physical stimulus intensities but also to qualitative comparative judgments, such as those of excellence of specimens in an educational scale. It should be possible also to verify it on comparative judgments which involve simultaneous and successive contrast. The law is stated as follows:[Equation omitted]in which S\&lt;sub\&gt;1\&lt;/sub\&gt; and S\&lt;sub\&gt;2\&lt;/sub\&gt; are the psychological scale values of the two compared stimuli; x\&lt;sub\&gt;12\&lt;/sub\&gt; is the sigma value corresponding to the proportion of judgments p\&lt;sub\&gt;1\&lt;/sub\&gt; \&gt; p\&lt;sub\&gt;2\&lt;/sub\&gt;. {$\varsigma\&$}lt;sub\&gt;1\&lt;/sub\&gt; is the discriminal dispersion of stimulus R\&lt;sub\&gt;1\&lt;/sub\&gt; and {$\varsigma\&$}lt;sub\&gt;2\&lt;/sub\&gt; is the dispersion of stimulus R\&lt;sub\&gt;2\&lt;/sub\&gt;. r is the correlation between the discriminal deviations of R\&lt;sub\&gt;1\&lt;/sub\&gt; and R\&lt;sub\&gt;2\&lt;/sub\&gt; in the same judgment. This law is basic for work on Weber's and Fechner's laws, applies to the judgments of a single observer who compares a series of stimuli by the method of paired comparisons when no "equal" judgments are allowed, and is a rational equation for the method of constant stimuli. The law is then applied to five cases each of which involves different assumptions and different degrees of simplification of the law for practical use. The weighting of the observation equations is discussed because the observation equations obtained with the five cases are not of the same reliability and hence should not be equally weighted.

  abstract = {To date, the most widely used method for empirical analysis of multiple alternative qualitative choices has been an extension of binary logit analysis called conditional logit analysis. Although this method is extremely attractive because of its computational simplicity, it is burdened with a property termed the "independence of irrelevant alternatives" that is quite unrealistic in many choice situations. We have proposed in this paper a computationally feasible method of estimation not constrained by the independence restriction and which allows for a much richer range of human behavior than does the conditional logit model. An important characteristic of the model is provision for correlation among the random components of utility and, as a by-product, the explicit allowance for variation in tastes across individuals for the attributes of alternatives. We have demonstrated the model and compared it with the logit one by analyzing the travel mode choice decisions of commuters to the central business district of Washington, D.C. Substantial differences are found in predictions based on the two models. The example allows three alternatives. Extension to four or five is quite feasible.},

  abstract = {In many decision tasks, we have a set of alternative choices and are faced with the problem of how to use our latent beliefs and preferences about each alternative to make a single choice. Cognitive and decision models typically presume that beliefs and preferences are distilled to a scalar latent strength for each alternative, but it is also critical to model how people use these latent strengths to choose a single alternative. Most models follow one of two traditions to establish this link. Modern psychophysics and memory researchers make use of signal detection theory, assuming that latent strengths are perturbed by noise, and the highest resulting signal is selected. By contrast, many modern decision theoretic modeling and machine learning approaches use the softmax function (which is based on Luce's choice axiom; Luce, 1959) to give some weight to non-maximal-strength alternatives. Despite the prominence of these two theories of choice, current approaches rarely address the connection between them, and the choice of one or the other appears more motivated by the tradition in the relevant literature than by theoretical or empirical reasons to prefer one theory to the other. The goal of the current work is to revisit this topic by elucidating which of these two models provides a better characterization of latent processes in m-alternative decision tasks, with a particular focus on memory tasks. In a set of visual memory experiments, we show that, within the same experimental design, the softmax parameter {$\beta$} varies across m-alternatives, whereas the parameter d{$\prime$} of the signal-detection model is stable. Together, our findings indicate that replacing softmax with signal-detection link models would yield more generalizable predictions across changes in task structure. More ambitiously, the invariance of signal detection model parameters across different tasks suggests that the parametric assumptions of these models may be more than just a mathematical convenience, but reflect something real about human decision-making.},

  abstract = {Develops a theory of memory retrieval and shows that it applies over a range of experimental paradigms. Access to memory traces is viewed in terms of a resonance metaphor. The probe item evokes the search set on the basis of probe--memory item relatedness, just as a ringing tuning fork evokes sympathetic vibrations in other tuning forks. Evidence is accumulated in parallel from each probe--memory item comparison, and each comparison is modeled by a continuous random walk process. In item recognition, the decision process is self-terminating on matching comparisons and exhaustive on nonmatching comparisons. The mathematical model produces predictions about accuracy, mean reaction time, error latency, and reaction time distributions that are in good accord with data from 2 experiments conducted with 6 undergraduates. The theory is applied to 4 item recognition paradigms (Sternberg, prememorized list, study--test, and continuous) and to speed--accuracy paradigms; results are found to provide a basis for comparison of these paradigms. It is noted that neural network models can be interfaced to the retrieval theory with little difficulty and that semantic memory models may benefit from such a retrieval scheme.

The authors show that a ballistic (deterministic within-trial) model using a simplified version of M. Usher and J. L. McClelland's (2001) nonlinear accumulation process with between-trial variability in accumulation rate and starting point is capable of accounting for the benchmark behavioral phenomena. The authors successfully fit their model to R. Ratcliff and J. N. Rouder's (1998) data, which exhibit many of the benchmark phenomena. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},
