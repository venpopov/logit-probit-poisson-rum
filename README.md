# logit-probit-poisson-rum

Source files for a publication on unifying the logit and probit Random Utility Models

Core question:

> Can the two canonical random-utility discrete-choice specifications—multinomial logit and multinomial probit—be derived as limit cases of a single stochastic accumulation/race mechanism, so that the logitprobit relationship is explained by a unified generative process rather than by informal distributional similarity or variance matching?
